When the server is started, root context and servlet context are configured (not bootstrap)

When the app start running, LoggingFilter is invoked, then IndexController is invoked (because the request mapping is "/") and return the redirect to URL /ticket/login. Then AuthenticationFilter is invoked and send redirect to /CustomerSupportSpring/login

The AuthenticationController is invoked because it has a method match with RequestMapping /login (the GET one) 
User will be prompt with login form.
After fill in the login form and click submit, the login with requestmapping value=login and method=POST method in AuthenticationController is invoked.
If the user existed in the database, the user will be prompted with a list of tickets as requested.
